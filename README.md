## Features
*AnimationsEditor* provides you with a broad toolset to bring your morphs to life.
Select any visible morph in your Squeak image and use up to four animations for offering your users a fully animated Squeak experience:
- `position` Let your morph wander around the screen.
- `color` Make your morphs chameleons: Change their color to any Squeak-supported color using a smooth transition effect.
- `rotation` Rotate your morph up to 360 degrees.
- `size` Let your morphs grow and shrink their size according to your needs.

Watch your animations evolve whenever you want with *Play Animations*. Take advantage of your work with AnimationsEditor and use the code generation feature: *Copy to Clipboard* transforms your animation to bare smalltalk - instantly use it in your Squeak project.
