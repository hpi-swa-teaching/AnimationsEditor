AnimationsEditor is a graphical tool for designing animations based on [Animations-Core](https://github.com/hpi-swa/animations). Bring your morphs to life using up to four handpicked animations. Effortlessly add generated code to your squeak project. Code less and achieve more - with AnimationsEditor.

## Features
*AnimationsEditor* provides you with a broad toolset to bring your morphs to life.
Select any visible morph in your Squeak image and use up to four animations for offering your users a fully animated Squeak experience:
- `position` Let your morph wander around the screen.
- `color` Make your morphs chameleons: Change their color to any Squeak-supported color using a smooth transition effect.
- `rotation` Rotate your morph up to 360 degrees.
- `size` Let your morphs grow and shrink their size according to your needs.

Watch your animations evolve whenever you want with *Play Animations*. Take advantage of your work with AnimationsEditor and use the code generation feature: *Copy to Clipboard* transforms your animation to bare smalltalk - instantly use it in your Squeak project. 

## Installation

Ready for AnimationsEditor? Follow our lean [setup guide](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/AnimationsEditor/wiki/Setup-Guide) to install AnimationsEditor.

## Getting Started with AnimationsEditor

Follow our step by step guide for using AnimationsEditor.

### Preparations
1. Install and open a supported Squeak image (see [setup guide](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/AnimationsEditor/wiki/Setup-Guide)).
2. Open AnimationsEditor by executing `AnimationsEditor open`. Now you should see the GUI of AnimationsEditor.

*Pro Tip: Use 'Button for it' on this code snippet in order to have quick access to AnimationsEditor.*

### Select morph
3. Create a morph in your Squeak image - this is the morph we want to bring to life. In case you are just playing around, create a dummy Morph with `Morph new openInHand`
5. Click on *Add Morph*
6. Click on your previous created Morph using left mouse key with 'opt'/'alt' key pressed. With Windows OS you can also use the middle mouse key.

Your morph should have been added to the property inspector. The property inspector provides you four animations.

### Supported animations

#### Morph color 
Enter a color into the text field and press *Play animations*. If a non-supported Color is entered, Squeak uses `Color white` as a default value.

#### Morph rotation

Enter an integer value in the text field and press *Play animations*.

#### Morph position
Enter the desired x- and y position the morph should move to and press *Play animations*.

#### Morph size
Enter the desired height and width of the morph and press *Play animations*.

## Development
### CI Pipeline and coverage
The CI pipeline is implemented using GitHub actions, and push is executed on each piece of code. The AnimationsEditor package is therefor executed under mac, ubuntu and windows on Squeak 5.3, Squeak 5.2, Squeak 5.1 and Squeak Trunk. In addition, the codecoverage is monitored and the badges above are updated.
